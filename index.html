<h1>Tuition</h1>

<p> Tuition pays for the core services provided by UC Berkeley to its students.
According to <a
href="https://regents.universityofcalifornia.edu/governance/policies/3101.html">Regents
Policy 3101</a>, it can be used to cover most costs within the university
budget. This includes areas such as faculty salaries and benefits, building
maintenance, libraries, and some student financial aid. Graduate and
undergraduate students are charged different amounts for tuition. Nonetheless,
these costs are standardized across all universities that are part of the UC
system.</p>

<h2>Nonresident Supplemental Tuition</h2>

In addition to the standard tuition, students who have not established
California residency must also pay nonresident supplemental tuition. This
amount differs between graduate and undergraduate students. More information on determining residency may be found on the <a href="https://www.ucop.edu/residency/process.html">UCOP website</a>.

<h2>Professional Degree Supplemental Tuition</h2>

Health Services website</a>. All eligible UC Berkeley students are
automatically enrolled in SHIP each academic year. Students who do not want
